# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction - Telecom Sector

This project was carried out as part of a **remote internship** with [SaiKet Systems](https://saiket.in/internship-program/)  

Objective: **analyze and predict customer churn** to help the marketing team reduce customer loss.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Understand the churn phenomenon** in telecom customers  
2. **Identify key factors** leading to customer departure  
3. **Build a predictive model** to anticipate churn  
4. **Provide actionable recommendations** for retention

---

## 📊 Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded the dataset (`7,043 customers`)
- Handled missing values
- Encoded 16 categorical variables
- Stratified train/test split

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used Python libraries (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`) for visualization
- Found that:
  - Customers with month-to-month contracts had **+42% churn risk**
  - Customers with <12 months tenure had **+65% churn risk**

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- K-Means clustering on selected variables
- Identified **4 customer segments**  
- Highlighted **847 high-value customers at risk**

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Tested **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**
- Tuned hyperparameters with `GridSearchCV`
- Best model: **ROC-AUC = 0.84**

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## 📈 Results

| Model              | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|--------------------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression| 80%      | 0.81    |
| Decision Tree      | 78%      | 0.79    |
| Random Forest      | **84%**  | **0.84**|

## Generated and Used Files

- `train_data_task1.csv` & `test_data_task1.csv`  
  Prepared training and testing datasets created by `data_preparation.py`.

- `customer_segments.csv`  
  Customer segmentation results generated by `customer_segmentation.py`.

- `figures/` and `models/` folders (optional)  
  These contain the generated plots and saved models, respectively.

## How to Run

1.  **Data Preparation**  
    Run:  
    ```bash
    python data_preparation.py

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis**
    Run:
    ```bash
    python exploratory_data_analysis.py

3. **Customer Segmentation**
    Run:
    ```bash
    python customer_segmentation.py

4. **Predictive Modeling**
    Run:
    ```bash
    python churn_prediction_modeling.py

## Important Notes

    The scripts must be run in order because each one uses files produced by the previous scripts.

    All files are read from and saved to the project root folder to simplify file paths.

    Some scripts generate plots that open in pop-up windows. You need to close these windows for the script to continue running.
